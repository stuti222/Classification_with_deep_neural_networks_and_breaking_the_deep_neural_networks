# Classification_with_deep_neural_networks_and_breaking_the_deep_neural_networks

Deep neural network classification for image data, using PyTorch. 

This project was part of the Advanced Machine Learning module, at Queen Mary University of London, March 2020 

## Abstract
This project aims to build a multi-class classifier using neural network model for classifying the images of handwritten digits from the MNIST data. Then an adversarial attack using the Fast Gradient Sign Method was implemented in order to break the neural network model built in the project.
